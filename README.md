Sales Superstore Insights: Storyboard Summary
1. Sales Performance Overview
I started my analysis with a high-level view of sales and profit across regions.
The West and East regions showed the highest sales, while the Central region revealed relatively lower profitability despite decent sales volume.
This helped me identify regions that may require closer attention in terms of cost management and sales strategies.

2. Category & Sub-Category Insights
When diving into product categories, I found that:
• Technology leads in both sales and profit.
• Office Supplies has moderate sales but contributes relatively low profit.
• Tables (under Furniture) show negative profit, indicating a potential issue with pricing, returns, or cost control.
These insights are crucial for re-evaluating inventory and pricing strategies, especially for underperforming sub-categories.

3. Customer Segments & Behavior
I analyzed customer segments based on their type and observed that:
• Consumer and Corporate customers generate the majority of sales.
• However, Home Office customers, while smaller in number, contribute decently to profit.
This suggests an opportunity to grow this segment with targeted marketing and personalized offerings.

4. Regional Contribution
Using a map visualization, I noticed:
• California and New York are the top contributors in both sales and profit.
• States like Texas and North Carolina have high sales but lower profit, indicating possible operational inefficiencies.
This insight allows me to recommend tailored, state-level strategies to improve profitability.

5. Sales Trend Over Time
A monthly trend analysis revealed a spike in sales during November and December, likely due to holiday season shopping.
This insight can be valuable for planning future promotional campaigns and inventory stocking.

6. Shipping Mode & Profitability
I evaluated the shipping modes and found that:
• Standard Class is the most commonly used.
• Second Class and Same Day delivery are associated with lower profit margins.
This insight suggests the need to review shipping partnerships or revise delivery charges to improve profitability.

7. Discount vs. Profit Relationship
Through a scatter plot analysis of discounts and profits, I observed:
• Higher discounts often lead to lower or negative profits.
• Sub-categories like Tables and Bookcases are more vulnerable to margin loss when discounts are applied.
This emphasizes the importance of optimizing discount strategies, especially for low-margin products.

8. Overall Insight
To boost overall profitability, I recommend focusing on the following:
• Reducing discounts on low-profit items
• Improving operations in the Central and South regions
• Targeting Corporate clients for higher-value sales
• Re-evaluating the Furniture pricing and cost structure
